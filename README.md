# Laptop Price Prediction with Lineer Regression 

Laptops are indispensable devices for both personal and professional use. As the demand for laptops continues to increase, it becomes important to accurately estimate their price based on their features. This can help their consumers make informed purchasing decisions and help manufacturers set competitive prices.

The problem we are trying to solve is to estimate laptop prices using linear regression. By training a linear regression model on a dataset of laptop prices and features, we can generate estimates for the prices of new laptops based on their specs. This can help both consumers and producers make more informed decisions.

I took the data from Trendyol through visual studio code with the beautifulsoup library. I used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn to correct and train the data.

For this project, I used a dataset on laptop prices from trendyol. The dataset contains information including brand, screen size, processor type, memory capacity, storage capacity, graphics card, and price. In total, the dataset contains 1176 rows and 17 variables.
